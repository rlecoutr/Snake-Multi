# Snake-Multi

This game is an advanced version of the classic game Snake made for a school project to conclude web application classes and to show our skills with Javascript and Node.JS. It's not fully fonctionnal (a few bugs remain).

It's basically a multiplayer snake where players have to enlarge their snake with the candy while dodging the others snakes (and himself) to avoid restarting to the beginning.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need node.js installed on your computer. Once the files downloaded, run the "server.js" with node.JS to start the server for the game.

To play, you will have to connect yourself to the server through your navigator with the following url : "http://localhost:8080"

### Play

This game is for now on a local server (on your computer here), it's adaptable to the local internet network (by changing the connection adress in the file client.js, set up on localhost)
